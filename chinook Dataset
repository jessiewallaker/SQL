--I worked with a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and included tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices and customers.
--From there I answered some questions and created SQL's that could help me find things like certain songs from artists and albums.

--Show customers (ID, full name, country) in USA.
SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'USA'
ORDER BY CustomerId


--What are the title(s) of the album(s) Santana has listed?
SELECT albums.ArtistId,albums.title, artists.Name
FROM chinook.albums albums
RIGHT JOIN chinook.artists artists
ON albums.ArtistId = artists.ArtistId
WHERE artists.Name = 'Santana'


--Name the album and artist who sings 'Overdose'
SELECT tra.Name AS 'Title Name', tra.Composer AS 'Composers', art.Name AS 'Artist Name', alb.title AS 'Album'
FROM chinook.albums alb
JOIN chinook.tracks tra
ON alb.AlbumId = tra.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.artists art
ON art.ArtistId = alb.ArtistId
WHERE tra.name = 'Overdose'


--What was the total sales in 2009?
SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%'


--Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, ROUND(SUM(inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName


--Provide a query that shows all the tracks, including album name, media type and genre.
SELECT tra.Name AS 'Track Name',alb.Title AS 'Album Title',med.Name AS 'Media Type',gen.Name AS 'Genre'
FROM chinook.tracks tra
JOIN chinook.albums alb
ON tra.AlbumId = alb.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.media_types med
ON med.MediaTypeId = tra.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.genres gen
ON gen.GenreId = tra.GenreId
GROUP BY alb.Title
